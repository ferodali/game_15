Game 15 for you to enjoy!

There are 2 version of this game for you to play: linux console and
android. Console version is in file 15.lua and android is in two files
main.lua and dialog.lua. And there is file 15lib.lua which is used in
both version of game.

You can start console version without any arguments, or you can start
it with one or two numerical arguments which determine size of puzzle.

In android version you can determine size of puzzle with clicking on
small 'S' button.

I use https://github.com/stevedonovan/AndroLua to run it in android
In android I placed whole directory as is and played it from there.
In alshell I issued these commands:
> .m game_15.15lib
> .m game_15.dialog
> .m game_15.main
> goapp 'game_15.main'

Happy playing!
